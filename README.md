# Energy_Density_Animation

This file is dedicated for the thesis project with Dr Dipan Kundu. The animation GiFs and code are meant to represent how volumetric energy density changes across different intial conditions. 
Likewise, the code for gravimetric energy density is also there. (Note: Volumetric and gravimetric energy densities are different; it is KJ/m^3 and KJ/kg respectively) 
Feel free to copy paste and modify the numbers under the comment of initial conditions or variables we can change.
